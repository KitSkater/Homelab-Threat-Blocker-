# Homelab-Threat-Blocker-Windows-
A lightweight, Python-based firewall hardening tool for Windows that protects your homelab or personal network by blocking connections from known malicious IP addresses using the built-in Windows Defender Firewall.

🔍 How It Works
Downloads updated IP blocklists from trusted open sources:

FireHOL Level 1

Spamhaus DROP

Skips trusted IPs (LAN, localhost, VPN ranges)

Removes old threat-blocking rules (created by previous runs)

Adds new inbound block rules to Windows Firewall for each bad IP

🧱 Rules are named with a clear prefix: HomelabThreatBlock, so they can be managed or deleted cleanly.

🚀 Features
🔒 Blocks connections from thousands of known malicious IPs

♻️ Cleans up old rules before each update to prevent firewall bloat

🌐 Uses netsh advfirewall — no third-party dependencies

🧠 Skips private/trusted IPs using a built-in whitelist

⚡ Simple enough to automate with Windows Task Scheduler

⚠️ Ethical & Safety Notice
❗ This tool is intended for personal or homelab use only on systems you control.

Never use it to interfere with or monitor systems you do not own.

Do not modify IP feeds to block or target legitimate services.

Review all changes made to your firewall after running.

This tool does not scan, probe, attack, or interact with any external systems — it is purely defensive and local.
